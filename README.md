# Soviet-Writers-Network-Project

Instruction of compiling the project:
Project members: Jing An, Wei Dai, Hengzhi Wu

1. If you do not have RStudio, download it.

2. Put Soviet Writer Project Shiny Interface.rmd and Soviet_Writer.csv in the same folder, open Soviet Writer Project Shiny Interface.rmd in RStudio.

3. In the code, change the directory if it is necessary. Download all the necessary packages to run the codes, for example, you need to write install.packages(‘igraph’) to download the package igraph in the console window.

4. After downloading all the necessary packages, click Run Document, then you can see our results in the form of a report.

5. We also publish our results to Shiny website. Please visit: https://jingan.shinyapps.io/Soviet_Writer_Project_Shiny_Interface/
If it calls error, please wait for 5 mins and reopen it. The Shiny website server uses RStudio to run our web application, but it has version problem so you cannot open our website more than once in a short time.
